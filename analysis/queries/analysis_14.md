### Application DELAYS greater than 10 secs.

This report shows the average delay for applications that took more than 10 secs to launch.

It groups the details by 'day', 'application type', and 'queue'.

Some of these delays may be expected, but this will help identify queue issues where there may not be enough resources available and the allocations for jobs might look like overall cluster performance problems.

This is generally a queue configuration or over subscription issue.
